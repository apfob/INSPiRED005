# INSPiRED005
B-mode and Strain Breast Radiomics 

This document provides guidence on how to follow and apply the code for the INSPiRED 005 project. 
(1) image segmentation 
(2) feature extraction 
(3) model development 

1) Image segmentation was performed using
2) Feature extraction was performed using pyradiomics, see files:
